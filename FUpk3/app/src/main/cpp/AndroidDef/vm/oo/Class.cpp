Notes on Linking and Verification

The basic way to retrieve a class is to load it, make sure its superclass
and interfaces are available, prepare its fields, and return it.  This gets
a little more complicated when multiple threads can be trying to retrieve
the class simultaneously, requiring that we use the class object's monitor
to keep things orderly.

The linking (preparing, resolving) of a class can cause us to recursively
load superclasses and interfaces.  Barring circular references (e.g. two
classes that are superclasses of each other), this will complete without
the loader attempting to access the partially-linked class.

With verification, the situation is different.  If we try to verify
every class as we load it, we quickly run into trouble.  Even the lowly
java.lang.Object requires CloneNotSupportedException; follow the list
of referenced classes and you can head down quite a trail.  The trail
eventually leads back to Object, which is officially not fully-formed yet.

The VM spec (specifically, v2 5.4.1) notes that classes pulled in during
verification do not need to be prepared or verified.  This means that we
are allowed to have loaded but unverified classes.  It further notes that
the class must be verified before it is initialized, which allows us to
defer verification for all classes until class init.  You can't execute
code or access fields in an uninitialized class, so this is safe.

It also allows a more peaceful coexistence between verified and
unverifiable code.  If class A refers to B, and B has a method that
refers to a bogus class C, should we allow class A to be verified?
If A only exercises parts of B that don't use class C, then there is
nothing wrong with running code in A.  We can fully verify both A and B,
and allow execution to continue until B causes initialization of C.  The
VerifyError is thrown close to the point of use.

This gets a little weird with java.lang.Class, which is the only class
that can be instantiated before it is initialized.  We have to force
initialization right after the class is created, because by definition we
have instances of it on the heap, and somebody might get a class object and
start making virtual calls on it.  We can end up going recursive during
verification of java.lang.Class, but we avoid that by checking to see if
verification is already in progress before we try to initialize it.

/*
Notes on class loaders and interaction with optimization / verification

In what follows, "pre-verification" and "optimization" are the steps
performed by the dexopt command, which attempts to verify and optimize
classes as part of unpacking jar files and storing the DEX data in the
dalvik-cache directory.  These steps are performed by loading the DEX
files directly, without any assistance from ClassLoader instances.

When we pre-verify and optimize a class in a DEX file, we make some
assumptions about where the class loader will go to look for classes.
If we can't guarantee those assumptions, e.g. because a class ("AppClass")
references something not defined in the bootstrap jars or the AppClass jar,
we can't pre-verify or optimize the class.

The VM doesn't define the behavior of user-defined class loaders.
For example, suppose application class AppClass, loaded by UserLoader,
has a method that creates a java.lang.String.  The first time
AppClass.stringyMethod tries to do something with java.lang.String, it
asks UserLoader to find it.  UserLoader is expected to defer to its parent
loader, but isn't required to.  UserLoader might provide a replacement
for String.

We can run into trouble if we pre-verify AppClass with the assumption that
java.lang.String will come from core.jar, and don't verify this assumption
at runtime.  There are two places that an alternate implementation of
java.lang.String can come from: the AppClass jar, or from some other jar
that UserLoader knows about.  (Someday UserLoader will be able to generate
some bytecode and call DefineClass, but not yet.)

To handle the first situation, the pre-verifier will explicitly check for
conflicts between the class being optimized/verified and the bootstrap
classes.  If an app jar contains a class that has the same package and
class name as a class in a bootstrap jar, the verification resolver refuses
to find either, which will block pre-verification and optimization on
classes that reference ambiguity.  The VM will postpone verification of
the app class until first load.

For the second situation, we need to ensure that all references from a
pre-verified class are satisified by the class' jar or earlier bootstrap
jars.  In concrete terms: when resolving a reference to NewClass,
which was caused by a reference in class AppClass, we check to see if
AppClass was pre-verified.  If so, we require that NewClass comes out
of either the AppClass jar or one of the jars in the bootstrap path.
(We may not control the class loaders, but we do manage the DEX files.
We can verify that it's either (loader==null && dexFile==a_boot_dex)
or (loader==UserLoader && dexFile==AppClass.dexFile).  Classes from
DefineClass can't be pre-verified, so this doesn't apply.)

This should ensure that you can't "fake out" the pre-verifier by creating
a user-defined class loader that replaces system classes.  It should
also ensure that you can write such a loader and have it work in the
expected fashion; all you lose is some performance due to "just-in-time
verification" and the lack of DEX optimizations.

There is a "back door" of sorts in the class resolution check, due to
the fact that the "class ref" entries are shared between the bytecode
and meta-data references (e.g. annotations and exception handler lists).
The class references in annotations have no bearing on class verification,
so when a class does an annotation query that causes a class reference
index to be resolved, we don't want to fail just because the calling
class was pre-verified and the resolved class is in some random DEX file.
The successful resolution adds the class to the "resolved classes" table,
so when optimized bytecode references it we don't repeat the resolve-time
check.  We can avoid this by not updating the "resolved classes" table
when the class reference doesn't come out of something that has been
checked by the verifier, but that has a nonzero performance impact.
Since the ultimate goal of this test is to catch an unusual situation
(user-defined class loaders redefining core classes), the added caution
may not be worth the performance hit.
